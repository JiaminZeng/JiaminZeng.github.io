- Reviews:
  - if you watch this, it is the culmination of millions of hours of human effort.  From the creation of the instruments, to the contours of the hall.  Every bow string pull and push, pulsing to a set of notes from a long dead genius.  It resonates now as it will in 200 years, a marvel of human creation.  Thank you to Charlie and your family to allow the rest of us to experience 90+ minutes of the joy of being human.
  - When this was over, the crowd was ecstatic and applauding wildly but Beethoven heard none of it.  The first violinist went to him and turned him around so he could see their reaction to his masterpiece. There are a few things in history that I wish I could time travel back and see and one of them would be the first performance of this with Beethoven himself conducting.
